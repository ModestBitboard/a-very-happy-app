# Why? Just why!?
Happy is my first app. It was made with the intention of making a basic python GUI that is turned into a Unix Executable which is packaged as a `.app` and then packaged again as a `.pkg` for proper distribution...

# What does this app do?
This app is pretty strait forward. The GUI has one button and when you press it it will ask you if you want to continue. If you press okay then it will use TTS to say "Generating happiness; please stand by" and after that it will open a random cat picture or gif off of the internet. There are technicly 19 total possibilities of cat pictures/gifs...
